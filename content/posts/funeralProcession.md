I was going through a trunk this weekend and came across some slides I took 
in the late 90's. I'm fairly certain I was riding home from work when I saw 
this scene, not sure why I was stopped on the side of the road in the middle 
of nowhere.

No modifications to the image, scanned at 3200dpi and dropped down to 300dpi
in PS. It could obviously use some levels adjustment as it is well underexposed.

Most likely shot on Fuji Velvia 50 with a Canon FTb (really miss that camera)
