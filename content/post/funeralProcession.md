I was going through a trunk this weekend and came across some slides I took in the late 90's. I'm fairly certain I was riding home from work when I saw this scene, not sure why I was stopped on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere.

Most likely shot on Fuji Velvia 50 with a Canon FTb (really miss that camera)
